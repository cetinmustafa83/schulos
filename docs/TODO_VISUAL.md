## Code Quality Metrics

### Current State
```
Components:        72 (HIGH DUPLICATION)
API Routes:        264 (INCONSISTENT)
LOC Total:         ~200K
Test Coverage:     <50%
Bundle Size:       ~2.5MB
```

### Target State (Week 8)
```
Components:        45 (consolidated)
API Routes:        80 (standardized)
LOC Total:         ~140K
Test Coverage:     70%+
Bundle Size:       ~1.8MB
```

### Reductions Needed
```
Components:        -27 (consolidate)
API Routes:        -184 (standardize)
LOC:               -60K (remove duplication)
Add Tests:         +2000 (increase coverage)
```

## Risk Tracking

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Module L not ready for German law** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Start Week 1, hire legal consultant | ⚠️ At Risk |
| **Browser lockdown impossible** | 🟡 HIGH | Research Electron/Kiosk.js alternatives | ✅ Planned |
| **Database schema incomplete** | 🟡 HIGH | Add all 39 tables Week 1-2 | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **API inconsistency** | 🟡 HIGH | Standardize responses + middleware | 🚀 Starting |
| **Test coverage <5%** | 🟡 HIGH | Add 2000+ tests in parallel | ✅ Planned |

---

## Success Criteria (Week 8 Deliverable)

- [x] 12 modules defined
- [ ] 100% module feature parity with PRD
- [ ] All 39+ DB tables implemented
- [ ] 264 API routes standardized
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Module L (GDPR) production-ready
- [ ] Zero hardcoded values (all DB-driven)
- [ ] Soft deletes + audit trail
- [ ] DPIA gating functional
- [ ] Self-hosting Docker image ready

---

## Deployment Timeline

```
Week 1-3:  Stabilize Foundation + Legal (Module L)
Week 4-6:  Implement Core Features (Modules A-H, K)
Week 7-8:  Polish, Test, Document, Deploy
Week 9:    Go-Live to Real School
```

---

## Notes

1. **Module L (GDPR) is non-negotiable** — German schools cannot use without it
2. **Database first** — Define all tables before UI code
3. **No hardcoding** — All rules, thresholds, templates must be DB-driven
4. **Tests early** — Each module needs tests, not afterthought
5. **Self-hosting path** — Docker + SQLite + local storage must work

**Created:** August 1, 2026  
**Target Completion:** September 26, 2026 (8 weeks)  
**Status:** On Track (with focused execution required)
