1. OfflineIndicator service worker - uncleared listeners (FIXED)
2. OfflineSyncManager - uncleared interval (FIXED)
3. RateLimitStatus - uncleared interval (FIXED)
4. CommunicationView - uncleared interval (FIXED)

### Remaining Issues to Fix ⏳
- CalendarView useEffect (High priority)
- DrawingCanvas useEffect (High priority)
- StudentStudyPlannerView setInterval (Medium priority)
- AiChatWidget setTimeout (Medium priority)
- 10+ other medium priority issues

### Tools Created

## Code Duplication Status

### High Duplication (Ready to Consolidate)
- 8 data tables → 1 `DataTable` component
- 10+ forms → 1 `FormBuilder` component
- 2 communication views → 1 `UnifiedCommunication` wrapper
- 4 analytics → 1 `AnalyticsPanel` component
- 5+ navigation files → 1 `UnifiedNavMenu` + config
- 60+ API fetch patterns → 1 `useApi()` hook

**Current Baseline:**
- 55 view/page components
- 3,000+ lines of table code (8 files)
- 4,000+ lines of form code (10+ files)
- 2,000+ lines of navigation code (5+ files)

**After Consolidation:**
- 12 unified modules
- 300 lines of table code (90% reduction)
- 400 lines of form code (90% reduction)
- 300 lines of navigation code (85% reduction)

**Projected Savings:** ~9,000 lines (50% of components)
